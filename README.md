I kinda went ham on it, so I probably only need to tweak a few things before it's done.

# Code
[First Draft Psuedo Code]
Code to turn on the box. 
Specifically the fan.
A code to tell the fan how fast it should spin and its limit.
Also to tell it that its limit is close and it should slow down.
We also need a code to tell us the speed of the fan and how close it is from its limit.
A couple of codes for the circuit to know what to do with certain wires.
A code that will turn on an LED that will on when the box is on. (Optional)
